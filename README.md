Front-End Prototype
-------------------

Open dist/home.html in a browser (everything has been compiled, concatenated, minified, etc. via gulp). 

Note that the home and search material have been consolidated into one webpage due to limited time constraints (from work). Hopefully this will not disappoint. Also, the React code that's been scaffolded in on my local machine, but it's still in the early stages. Don't know when I'll get around to doing it...
